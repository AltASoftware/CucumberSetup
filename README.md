# CucumberSetup
The Hello World of Cucumber

Based on 'the simplest' java cucumber project. 

Running from Eclipse and almost running from the maven command line:
Need to copy the .feature file after the maven build to a path where the testrunner will find it.

Fixed on 11/23: We no longer need anything related to test or featurew paths in the source code or pom.xml.
